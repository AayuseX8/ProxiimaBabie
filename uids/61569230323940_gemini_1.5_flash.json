        "text": "Math, or mathematics, is the abstract study of topics encompassing quantity, structure, space, and change.  It's a vast field with many branches, including:\n\n* **Arithmetic:**  The basic operations of numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n* **Algebra:**  The study of symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols to solve equations and understand relationships.\n* **Geometry:** The study of shapes, sizes, and relative positions of figures.\n* **Calculus:**  The study of continuous change, including derivatives and integrals.\n* **Statistics:** The collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.\n* **Probability:** The study of chance and likelihood.\n* **Number Theory:** The study of properties of numbers, especially integers.\n* **Logic:** The study of valid reasoning and argumentation.\n\nEssentially, math is a language and a tool used to describe and understand patterns, relationships, and structures in the world around us. It's used in everything from everyday tasks like cooking and budgeting to complex scientific research and technological advancements.  It's based on axioms (statements assumed to be true) and logical deductions from those axioms.\n"
