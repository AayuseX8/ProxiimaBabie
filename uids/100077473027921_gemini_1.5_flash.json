        "text": "\"Ishq\" (इश्क़) is a Persian/Urdu word that means **love**, but it signifies a much deeper and more intense form of love than the typical English word \"love.\"  It often implies a passionate, all-consuming, and sometimes even obsessive love.  It's frequently used in romantic contexts, particularly in poetry and songs from the Indian subcontinent.  The feeling described by \"ishq\" is often associated with:\n\n* **Intense longing:**  A deep yearning for the beloved.\n* **Sacrifice:**  A willingness to give up everything for the object of one's affection.\n* **Spiritual connection:**  A feeling of profound connection that transcends the physical.\n* **Suffering:**  The pain and anguish that can accompany intense love.\n\nWhile \"love\" can encompass many different types of affection, \"ishq\" often points to a more mystical and all-encompassing kind of love, often bordering on the spiritual or even the divine.  The word carries a significant weight and emotional depth that is difficult to fully capture in a single English translation.\n"

        "text": "Jainism is a religion that originated in ancient India.  It's characterized by a strong emphasis on **non-violence (ahimsa)**, **self-discipline**, and the pursuit of **spiritual liberation (moksha)**.  Here are some key aspects of Jainism:\n\n* **Ahimsa (Non-violence):** This is the central tenet of Jainism.  Jains strive to minimize harm to all living beings, including insects and microorganisms.  This principle guides their dietary choices, occupations, and daily actions.  Many Jains are vegetarian or vegan, and some even use mouth covers to avoid accidentally inhaling insects.\n\n* **Three Jewels (Triratnas):**  These are the core principles of Jainism:\n    * **Right Faith (Samyak Darshan):**  Correct understanding of the nature of reality and the path to liberation.\n    * **Right Knowledge (Samyak Gyan):**  Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of the principles of Jainism.\n    * **Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra):**  Living a life guided by ethical principles, including ahimsa, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and non-attachment.\n\n* **Karma:** Jains believe in karma, but not in the same way as some other religions.  They see karma as a subtle substance that clings to the soul, causing rebirth and suffering.  The goal of Jain practice is to shed this karmic burden.\n\n* **Liberation (Moksha):** The ultimate goal in Jainism is to achieve moksha, a state of complete liberation from the cycle of birth and death.  This is achieved through rigorous self-discipline, meditation, and the elimination of karma.\n\n* **Different sects:** Jainism has two main sects: Digambaras and Svetambaras, which differ slightly in their practices and beliefs, particularly regarding the role of women and monastic life.\n\n* **Fasting and Asceticism:**  Many Jains practice fasting and asceticism as a way to purify themselves and reduce their karmic burden.  This can range from simple dietary restrictions to more extreme practices undertaken by monks and nuns.\n\n\nIn short, Jainism is a complex and nuanced religion with a rich history and a profound ethical framework.  Its emphasis on non-violence and self-discipline makes it a unique and compelling spiritual path.\n"
